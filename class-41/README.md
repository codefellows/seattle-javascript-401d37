## Notes

### Using React Native and Expo to start an app

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) | [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/)

```bash
npm install --global expo-cli
expo init my-project
cd my-project
npm start
```

This will open up the Expo app runner, which allows you to run your app on a real device, or a simulator (see notes below)

### Installing Tools

Mac Users - Install XCode so you can use the iOS Simulators

All Users - Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) so that you can run an Android phone simulator

#### Android Studio

Once installed, apply all updates and then open the AVD Manager, from the "Tools" menu.

Choose a device and the latest version of the Android OS, and then install the update (it may take > 30 minutes).

Once done, you can then re-open the AVD Manager and start an Android Virtual Device from which you can test
